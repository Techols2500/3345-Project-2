Instructions: This is an individual assignment.  Answers should be your own work.
              You are expected to code this yourself from scratch by thinking 
              through the requirements and design, then writing the code.  However,
              you may use code from the author's BinarySearchTree.


Introduction:

   In this project you will create a binary search tree.


Description:

   Create a class called MySearchTree.  MySearchTree will implement a binary 
   search tree.  MySearchTree will be a generic class storing a value of the
   generic type.  

   It should have the following methods.  The methods should 
   all operate on the object making the call (none are static).  

   All of the methods should use recursion (except for main).

   10 points
   a) add
       Adds a node to the tree containing the passed value.  

   10 points
   b) find
        Returns true if the value passed is in the tree.

   10 points
   c) leafCount
        Returns the count of all of the leaves in the tree.

   10 points
   d) parentCount
        Returns the count of all of the parents in the tree.

   10 points
   e) height
        Returns the height of the tree.

   10 points
   f) isPerfect
        Returns true if the tree is a perfect tree.
        (A perfect tree is filled at every level).

   10 points
   g) ancestors
        Returns the ancestor values of the passed value.

   10 points
   h) inOrderPrint
        Prints node values using an inorder traversal.
   
   10 points
   i) preOrderPrint
        Prints node values using a preorder traversal.

   10 points
   j) Main
        Demonstrates all of the above methods.
